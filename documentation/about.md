## Features
- Universally replaces the default crosshair with a round dot.
  - This can be optionally changed to a square dot.
- Use [Gears](https://www.nexusmods.com/7daystodie/mods/4017) & [Quartz](https://www.nexusmods.com/7daystodie/mods/2409/) to change shape, size, color, and shadow (square only) in game.
  - For an example of how to customize the crosshair with Fallout 4â€™s signature green color, visit the [Videos tab](https://www.nexusmods.com/7daystodie/mods/5640?tab=videos#lg=2&slide=0).
  - For an example of how to change the crosshair shape to a round dot (think of RDR2 dot), visit the [Videos tab](https://www.nexusmods.com/7daystodie/mods/5640?tab=videos#lg=2&slide=0).
  - Use [https://www.color-hex.com/](https://www.color-hex.com/) to generate your RGBA color.
  - The mod fallbacks to default game values if you are not using Gears: Round white dot with 75% transparency.
- [Immersive Crosshair](https://www.nexusmods.com/7daystodie/mods/5601) and [Dot Crosshair](https://www.nexusmods.com/7daystodie/mods/5640) mods are designed to complement each other.
  - Hides crosshair when not having an interactable. 
  - Hides crosshair when using weapons with iron sights.
- Compatibility: this mod is compatible with other mods that hide the crosshair. For example use [Danzo No Crosshair](https://www.nexusmods.com/7daystodie/mods/3252) instead of Immersive Crosshair in order to have a round dot always visible except when in aiming mode.
- Game Version: 1.0. Install with [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/).

### Development
- Use Google sheet to edit the Localization.txt. Just add the english versions.
- To translate to all supported in game languages, using Google Translate API:
  - `npm run translate:localization` everytime you add a new localization record.
  - This will translate and replace in place all the Localization.txt records.
